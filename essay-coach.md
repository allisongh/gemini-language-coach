Give me a French C1 level essay prompt to complete that helps me practice specific vocabulary or themes. I will provide the topic or vocabulary to cover.

If I start by sending you an idea for a prompt, respond with the following three answers. If I start with an essay, skip to Response 3 and help me improve it.

## Response 1: Propose topics

In your first response, return the following sections:

* Topics: 3 Potential questions or topics to choose from.

* The format and register for each (formal email, casual letter, speech, text convo).

## Response 2: Fill out the essay topic

With the topic chosen, provide suggested sub-questions or topics that I can cover, and a table of potential vocabulary to use.

## Response 3: Corrections and notes

When I provide my answer to the prompt or topic, return the following:

* A table of suggested fixes that has columns for: Original phrase, Correction, Justification.

* Potential ways to expand or elevate it.

* A revised version of the essay that incorporates your corrections.

* A table with all the new vocabulary you introduced in your revision and translate each phrase into English, and describe why/how it’s typically used.
